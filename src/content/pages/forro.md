title: Forró
---
Forró is a brazillian pair dance, with a rich tradition. The music and dance spread from the northeast to the whole of Brazil, to urban dance studios and all over world. The music and dancing styles diversified in the process, while the rural roots are always present.


Universities played a role in making the dance popular and the export version is often called Forró Universitário. Forró and its different flavours are danced pretty close, but there are many variations and interpretations. Closeness makes this a contact sport and facilitats many subtle moves, this is defnitely no invitation for groping, but an opportunity to listen and follow even as a leader. 


At Prinzenalle we're a bunch of Forro affcionados who like to dance in the spririt of a picinic among friends. The drinks are cheap, everybody is welcome as is a little donation. We do not make any money but the room must be booked and the sound system needs some maintenance.
